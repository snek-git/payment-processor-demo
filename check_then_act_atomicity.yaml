    title: Detect concurrency and synchronization problems
    prompt: |
      Identify potential concurrency issues that could lead to race conditions, deadlocks, or data corruption in multi-threaded or distributed environments.

      Focus on patterns where shared state might be accessed or modified without proper synchronization, especially in contexts involving money, user data, or critical business logic.

      Use high confidence (>0.7) for clear synchronization problems that could impact data integrity or system reliability.

    languages: ["python", "java", "javascript", "typescript", "go", "ruby"]
    complexity: advanced
    confidence_threshold: 0.7
    priority: 9
